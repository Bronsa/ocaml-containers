(** {1 Futures for concurrency} *)

type 'a state =
  | Done of 'a
  | Waiting
  | Failed of exn

type 'a t
(** A future value of type 'a *)

type 'a future = 'a t

(** {2 Constructors} *)

val return : 'a -> 'a t
(** Future that is already computed *)

val fail : exn -> 'a t
(** Future that fails immediately *)

val make : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a t
(** Create a future, representing a value that will be computed by
      the function. If the function raises, the future will fail. *)

val make1 : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> 'b t
val make2 : ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'a -> 'b -> 'c t

(** {2 Basics} *)

val get : 'a t -> 'a
(** Blocking get: wait for the future to be evaluated, and get the value,
    or the exception that failed the future is returned.
    raise e if the future failed with e *)

val state : 'a t -> 'a state
(** State of the future *)

val is_done : 'a t -> bool
(** Is the future evaluated (success/failure)? *)

(** {2 Combinators} *)

val on_success : 'a t -> ('a -> unit) -> unit
(** Attach a handler to be called upon success *)

val on_failure : _ t -> (exn -> unit) -> unit
(** Attach a handler to be called upon failure *)

val on_finish : 'a t -> ('a state -> unit) -> unit
(** Attach a handler to be called when the future is evaluated *)

val flat_map : ('a -> 'b t) -> 'a t -> 'b t
(** Monadic combination of futures *)

val and_then : 'a t -> (unit -> 'b t) -> 'b t
(** Wait for the first future to succeed, then launch the second *)

val sequence : 'a t list -> 'a list t
(** Future that waits for all previous sequences to terminate. If any future
    in the list fails, [sequence l] fails too. *)

val choose : 'a t list -> 'a t
(** Choose among those futures (the first to terminate). Behaves like
    the first future that terminates, by failing if the future fails *)

val map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t
(** Maps the value inside the future. The function doesn't run in its
    own task; if it can take time, use {!flat_map} *)

(** {2 Helpers} *)

val read_chan : in_channel -> Bytes.t t
(** Read the whole channel *)

type subprocess_res = <
  errcode : int;
  stdout : Bytes.t;
  stderr : Bytes.t;
>

val spawn_process : ?stdin:string -> string -> subprocess_res t
(** Spawn a sub-process with the given command (and possibly input);
      returns a future containing [(returncode, stdout, stderr)] *)

val sleep : float -> unit t
(** Future that returns with success in the given amount of seconds. Blocks
    the thread! If you need to wait on many events, consider
    using {!Timer} *)

(** {2 Event timer} *)

module Timer : sig
  type t
  (** A scheduler for events. It runs in its own thread. *)

  val create : unit -> t
  (** A new timer. *)

  val after : t -> float -> unit future
  (** Create a future that waits for the given number of seconds, then
      awakens with [()] *)

  val at : t -> float -> unit future
  (** Create a future that evaluates to [()] at the given Unix timestamp *)

  val stop : t -> unit
  (** Stop the given timer, cancelling pending tasks *)
end

  val (>>=) : 'a t -> ('a -> 'b t) -> 'b t
  val (>>) : 'a t -> (unit -> 'b t) -> 'b t

(** {2 Low level} *)

val stop_pool : unit -> unit
(** Stop the thread pool *)
