(** {1 Hash combinators}

Combination of hashes based on the Murmur Hash (64 bits). See
{{: https://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/MurmurHash2_64.cpp?attredirects=0} this page}
*)

(** {2 Definitions} *)

type t = int
(** A hash value is a positive integer *)

type state = int64
(** State required by the hash function *)

type 'a hash_fun = 'a -> state -> state
(** Hash function for values of type ['a], merging a fingerprint of the
    value into the state of type [t] *)

(** {2 Applying Murmur Hash} *)

val init : state
(** Initial value *)

val finish : state -> int
(** Extract a usable hash value *)

val apply : 'a hash_fun -> 'a -> int
(** Apply a hash function to a value.
    [apply f x] is the same as [finish (f x init)] *)

(** {2 Basic Combinators}

 Those combinators have been renamed in 0.13, so as to
 remove the trailing "_".
 They are now defined by the application of {!Make}

(** {2 Generic Hashing}

  Parametrize over the state, and some primitives to hash basic types.
  This can for instance be used for cryptographic hashing or
  checksums such as MD5.
