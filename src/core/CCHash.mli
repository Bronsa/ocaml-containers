(** {1 Hash combinators}

Combination of hashes based on the Murmur Hash (64 bits). See

*)

(** {2 Definitions} *)

type t = int
(** A hash value is a positive integer *)

type state = int64
(** State required by the hash function *)

type 'a hash_fun = 'a -> state -> state
(** Hash function for values of type ['a], merging a fingerprint of the
    value into the state of type [t] *)

val init : state
(** Initial value *)

val finish : state -> int
(** Extract a usable hash value *)

val apply : 'a hash_fun -> 'a -> int
(** Apply a hash function to a value *)
