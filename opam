"Another large release, with many new features:

- performance improvements, in particular for string search (using KMP)
- `CCHet`, a heterogeneous map with unique keys
- `CCImmutArray`, immutable arrays
- `CCString.pad`, for webscale string padding!

as usual, see https://github.com/c-cube/ocaml-containers/blob/0.17/CHANGELOG.adoc"
