(** {1 IO Utils}

Simple utilities to deal with basic Input/Output tasks in a resource-safe
way. For advanced IO tasks, the user is advised to use something
like Lwt or Async, that are far more comprehensive.
This module depends on {!CCGen}.

@since 0.6

{b NOTE} this was formerly a monadic IO module. The old module is now
in [containers.advanced] under the name [CCMonadIO].

Examples:

- obtain the list of lines of a file:

{[
# let l = CCIO.(with_in "/tmp/some_file" read_lines);;
]}

- transfer one file into another:

{[
# CCIO.(
  with_in "/tmp/input"
    (fun ic ->
      with_out ~flags:[Open_creat] ~mode:0o644 "/tmp/output"
        (fun oc ->
          Seq.chunks 512 ic |> Seq.to_output oc
        )
    )
) ;;
]}
*)

type 'a gen = unit -> 'a option  (** See {!CCGen} *)

(** {2 Input} *)

val with_in : ?mode:int -> ?flags:open_flag list ->
              string -> (in_channel -> 'a) -> 'a
(** Open an input file with the given optional flag list, calls the function
    on the input channel. When the function raises or returns, the
    channel is closed. *)

val read_chunks : ?size:int -> in_channel -> string gen
(** Read the channel's content into chunks of size [size] *)

val read_line : in_channel -> string option
(** Read a line from the channel. Returns [None] if the input is terminated.
    The "\n" is removed from the line. *)

val read_lines : in_channel -> string gen
(** Read all lines. The generator should be traversed only once. *)

val read_lines_l : in_channel -> string list
(** Read all lines into a list *)

val read_all : in_channel -> string
(** Read the whole channel into a buffer, then converted into a string *)

(** {6 Output} *)

val with_out : ?mode:int -> ?flags:open_flag list ->
               string -> (out_channel -> 'a) -> 'a
(** Same as {!with_in} but for an output channel *)

val with_out_a : ?mode:int -> ?flags:open_flag list ->
                  string -> (out_channel -> 'a) -> 'a
(** Similar to {!with_out} but with the [Open_append] and [Open_creat]
    flags activated *)

val write_line : out_channel -> string -> unit
(** Write the given string on the channel, followed by "\n" *)

val write_gen : ?sep:string -> out_channel -> string gen -> unit
(** Write the given strings on the output. If provided, add [sep] between
    every two string (but not at the end) *)

val write_lines : out_channel -> string gen -> unit
(** Write every string on the output, followed by "\n". *)

val write_lines_l : out_channel -> string list -> unit

(** {2 Misc for Generators} *)

val tee : ('a -> unit) list -> 'a gen -> 'a gen
(** [tee funs gen] behaves like [gen], but each element is given to
    every function [f] in [funs] at the time the element is produced. *)

(** {6 File and file names}

How to list recursively files in a directory:
{[
# let files = CCIO.File.read_dir ~recurse:true (CCIO.File.make "/tmp");;
# CCIO.write_lines stdout files;;
]}

See {!File.walk} if you also need to list directories:

{[
# let content = CCIO.File.walk (CCIO.File.make "/tmp");;
# CCGen.map CCIO.File.show_walk_item content |> CCIO.write_lines stdout;;
]}
*)

module File : sig
  type t = string
  (** A file is always represented by its absolute path *)

  val to_string : t -> string

  val make : string -> t
  (** Build a file representation from a path (absolute or relative) *)

  val exists : t -> bool

  val is_directory : t -> bool

  val remove : t -> unit

  val read_dir : ?recurse:bool -> t -> t gen
  (** [read_dir d] returns a sequence of files and directory contained
      in the directory [d] (or an empty stream if [d] is not a directory)
      @param recurse if true (default [false]), sub-directories are also
        explored *)

  type walk_item = [`File | `Dir] * t

  val walk : t -> walk_item gen
  (** similar to {!read_dir} (with [recurse=true]), this function walks
      a directory recursively and yields either files or directories.
      Is a file anything that doesn't satisfy {!is_directory} (including
      symlinks, etc.) *)

  val show_walk_item : walk_item -> string
end
